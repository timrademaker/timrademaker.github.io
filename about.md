I’m Tim, a generalist programmer at Behaviour. Most of my programming experience is with C++ and Python, and I have some experience with continuous integration and automated testing.

In my free time, I read books, play games, maintain a <a href="http://clerqbot.com/">Discord bot</a>, and try to learn new languages.
